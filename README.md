## Contribution Guidelines

### Coding Standards

While there are no strict coding standards, contributors are encouraged to maintain a clean and organized codebase. Below are some best practices and conventions to consider:

- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Comment your code to explain what specific animations do.
- Include a `README.md` for complex animations to outline usage instructions.

### File and Folder Naming Conventions

- Use hyphens to separate words (e.g., `button-animation`).
- Use lowercase letters for all filenames and folder names.
- Be descriptive but concise in naming files and folders.
- Group related files into folders with descriptive names.
- Use a consistent structure for multi-file animations (e.g., `fade-transition/fade-transition.html`).
- Optionally, include version numbers in filenames for evolving animations (e.g., `button-animation-v1.html`).
- Always include the correct file extension for the file type.
